# HCI Credit Credit ScoreCard Model

This project is the final project of the virtual internship experience from Rakamin Academy. I was asked to find insights from the data provided and do modeling with progress including 

1. Problem Research, 
2. Data Pre-Processing, 
3.Data Visualization and Business Insight, 
4. Machine Learning Implementation and Evaluation, 
5. Business recommendation.

Based on the results of the experiments I did, the Business Recommendations that I gave were The Logistic Regression Model can help to predict potential customers with more successful paying rates and the Decision Tree Model can help to predict potential customers with high default rates. The use of the model can be adjusted to the case you want to look for or choose a model according to the results of the meeting with bos.

Furthermore, the recommendation that I can give is to conduct a campaign to attract potential customers with high salaries because according to the analysis, customers with high salaries will have a smaller percentage of defaults. But you need to be careful with some customers with certain jobs because according to the analysis they can default on credit.
